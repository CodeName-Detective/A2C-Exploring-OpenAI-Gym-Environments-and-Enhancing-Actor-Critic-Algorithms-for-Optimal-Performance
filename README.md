# A2C: Exploring OpenAI Gym Environments and Enhancing Actor Critic Algorithms for Optimal Performance

This project is aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of reinforcement learning, specifically focusing on Actor Critic ALgorithms. The project will involve exploring the OpenAI Gym library, implementing the A2C algorithm as described in DeepMind's seminal paper, and subsequently improving the A2C algorithm for enhanced performance and stability.

## Environments:
- CartPole
- Lunar Lander
- Inverted Pendulum
- Bi-Pedal Walker
